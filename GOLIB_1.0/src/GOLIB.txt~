The version 0.7 of MC++ provides a collection of C++ classes for computation of interval bounds, convex/concave bounds, Taylor models, and polyhedral relaxations for factorable functions and programs, based on C++ templates and operator/function overloading. MC++ also provides C++ classes for the bounding and local/global optimization of parametric initial value problems in ODEs.

On distribution, MC++ should contain four directories: <tt>src</tt>, <tt>include</tt>, <tt>examples</tt>, and <tt>docs</tt>. The library comes with a Doxygen documentation, which can be accessed by opening the file <tt>docs/html/index.html</tt> with any html interpreter. Also, a number of simple examples is provided in the <tt>examples</tt> subdirectory that should help the user understand how to use the various C++ classes. MC++ consists of header files only (no need to build/link a library), which can be found in the <tt>src</tt> directory. Header files for <A href="http://www.fadbad.com/fadbad.html">FADBAD++</A> doing automatic differentiation are provided by default in the <tt>include</tt> directory. 

\section sec_MCinstall Installing MC++

cd into the <tt>src</tt> directory, and type

<tt>
> make install
</tt>

to create symbolic links to the header files in the <tt>include</tt> directory. Note that the code should compile without warning using gcc version 4.0 or higher.

In order to remove all symbolic links created in the <tt>include</tt> directory, type

<tt>
> make cleaninstall
</tt>

from the <tt>src</tt> directory.

<b>Important Notes:</b>
MC++ relies on a number of third party libraries.
- Validated interval computations are possible via either <A href="http://www.ti3.tu-harburg.de/Software/PROFILEnglisch.html">PROFIL</A> or <A href="http://www.math.uni-wuppertal.de/~xsc/software/filib.html">FILIB++</A>.
- Likewise, both the optimizers <A href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/optimization/cplex-optimizer/">CPLEX</A> and <A href="http://www.gurobi.com/">GUROBI</A> can be used to solve polyhedral relaxations of factorable programs.
- Numerical solution of NLP and IVP relies on the libraries <A href="https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt">IPOPT</A> and <A href="https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/description/description.html">SUNDIALS/CVODES</A>, respectively.
- Linear algebra computaitons requires the libraries BLAS and LAPACK.

All these libraries must be installed prior to using MC++, and the paths to these libraries and header files are to be changed in the first section of the <tt>makeoptions.mk</tt> file in the <tt>src</tt> directory.

\section sec_MCrun Running MC++

Change into the <tt>examples</tt> directory, and select one of the subdirectories, e.g.

<tt>
> cd examples/MC-1D
</tt>

Type:

<tt>
> make
</tt>

at the command line, to create the executable file <tt>exm_1D</tt>. This executable can then be run by typing:

<tt>
> ./MC-1D
</tt>

This executable generate a file containing the relaxations and subgradients. These results can be displayed with the program <A href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">GNUPLOT</A> by typing:

<tt>
> gnuplot MC-1D.g
</tt>
